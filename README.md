# spidr-form

Spidr Design Coding Challenge

Create a simple React app that contains a single-page form that contains the following fields:

- First name

- Last name

- Phone number

- Email address

- Guess the air fryer’s cost (dollar amount)

- A very, very secret 16-digit Spidr PIN. Digits are formatted with dashes in groups of four “####-####-####-####”.

There should be a submit button at the bottom of the form. This doesn’t need to do anything meaningful- just print the user’s form data to the console.
